Welcome to SkillSwap, a peer-to-peer learning platform designed to bridge the knowledge gap within academic communities through collaborative learning.

Upon login, you are greeted by a streamlined dashboard. A core feature of our platform is the AI-Powered Partner Suggestions. This section uses intelligent filtering to recommend specific peers whose expertise aligns directly with your learning objectives, making it easier than ever to find the right mentor.

To ensure high-quality matches, users can dynamically manage their profiles. Here, you can update your current technical competencies—like Python or Data Structures—and identify specific skills you wish to acquire. ...

The Find a Partner interface allows for targeted discovery. Students can browse diverse profiles, evaluate specific skill sets, and initiate connection requests to build their learning network with just one click.

Our system also provides a comprehensive view of all network interactions. Within the Connections tab, you can monitor outgoing requests and manage incoming invitations to ensure a structured and productive collaborative experience. ...

Once a partnership is established, integrated messaging facilitates real-time coordination. SkillSwap transforms individual learning into a collective, tech-driven success. Thank you.
